# directoryformatter
## What It Does
  This program recursively walks through a directory of your choice and formats the folder and file names to remove spaces and any other special characters other than underscores, "\_", dashes, "-", and periods, "." The formatter also capitalizes the first letter of each word originally preceded by a space while maintaining acronym capatilization unlike title case. So, "Directory formatter's personal Diary OMG!.txt" would become, "DirectoryFormattersPersonalDiaryOMG.txt"
  
## How to Install
  Created using Python 3.7.1. No special directories or support needed. The OS package is platform agnostic so this program should work on Mac, Linux, and Windows.
